# Checkpoint #2

 - Build a new public repo - github
 - create a new branch for the work in checkpoint #1, create the branch with the checkpoint1 name
 - Create the terraform project and terraform resources and commit that to the repo in the branch checkpoint1

# Objective

 - Dont worry about best practices
 - Make sure you're refrencing other resources using the terraform resource variables, IE, refrence the resource group using the "azurerm_resource_group.rg.name" where the RG name is needed. This is a crucial concept within Terraform
 - Really just understand the basics of git and how to create a branch, work in the branch, commit code, and push code to the repo
 - Understand the TF commands to deploy and destroy the environment

## Azure Resources:
 - Resource Group
 - Virtual Network
 - Subnets
 - Linux Virtual Machines
 - Public IP Address
 - Network Security Group
